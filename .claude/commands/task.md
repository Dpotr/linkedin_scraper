# /task Command

The task is: $ARGUMENTS.

Ask me questions about this task if you see any gaps, ambiguities, edge cases or options of implementation. If you don't have questions or when I answered all of them, don't start any code edits and keep writing me "No more questions, we can move on!" until I explicitly tell you to do something.
